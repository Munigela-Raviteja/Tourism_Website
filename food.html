        </font>
        From being the perfect start to a “healthy” morning in most Delhi households, to a meal for hungry college students and even a late-night snack, paranthas are definitely on the top of the list when it comes to my favorite food in Delhi. Choose from a plain one or select a stuffing of your choice - potatoes, cauliflower, radish, eggs,
         keema, bananas or even last night'
         s left over dal - the options are galore.

        Whoever thought grilled chunks of meat or fish marinated in aromatic Indian spices couldn’t give you joy should think again. While we Delhiites have a lot to be thankful for to the Mughals, Kebabs are one of them. Whether it is Kebabs being delivered to your car, a quintessentially Delhi experience, to food stalls and fine dining restaurants across the city, try this popular dish and you will be hooked forever.

        Here’s a piece of advice: This dish is best enjoyed on an empty stomach. Rich, spicy and heavy, this is one of the most popular Punjabi dishes and is definitely on my list of top 10 must-try dishes in Delhi. Don’t be surprised if you find it on the breakfast menu of restaurants across the capital. You can find this lip smacking dish at all food joints, be it local joints or restaurants, given its popularity with delhiites. It is generally accompanied with Lassi.

        As you enter Old Delhi and walk into the serpentine lanes, you can’t help but be drawn to the aroma of one of the region’s signature delicacies, the Nihari. This rich, spicy broth of slow cooked meat is served alongside hot tandoori rotis or preferably khameeri rotis. The dish was a favourite within the royal families, who used to feast on it in the mornings. Today it serves as the ideal nourishment for labourers, rickshaw pullers, coolies and many others looking to kick start their day.

        </font>Ok, so we aren’t going to take the credit away from Kolkata, where the original Kathi roll recipe was developed, but Delhi has its own delicious variants. From street stalls offering a variety of rolls, to supermarkets stocking up on frozen options and even the posh Delhi restaurants, Kathi rolls are a befitting food option for busy Delhiites on the go.

        This one bags the prize for being one of the most popular snacks, be it in office complexes, birthdays or even cocktail parties. It is not uncommon to find vendors outside almost every office building, housing area and market place selling Momos. These tasty dumplings are available in both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options and are enjoyed with the fiery-red sauce.

        You are probably familiar with this line used across all Delhi households “Khaane ke baad kuch meetha ho jaye” (“Let’s eat something sweet after a meal”). With the extensive variety of desserts offered in the capital, it is hard to say no. From the piping-hot Jalebis and lip-smacking Rabri Falooda, to innovative Kulfis in flavours like Custard Apple, Tamarind and Aam Papad, the delicious Motichoor Ladoo made from pure desi ghee and Blueberry Cheesecake; Delhi sure loves its sweets!
